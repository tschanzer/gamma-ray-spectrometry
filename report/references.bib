	abstract = {Previous experimental studies of the response of NaI(Tl) to gamma rays have indicated that the pulse height is not strictly proportional to the energy of the absorbed gamma. It is the purpose of this paper to point out that the nonproportional response to gammas implies a nonproportional response to electrons, which results in an intrinsic broadening of the full-energy peak in the pulse-height distribution from monoenergetic gamma rays. The magnitude of this effect is such that it results in a significant contribution to the total line width for scintillation crystals of typical dimensions. The work reported here is based on Monte Carlo calculations using the nonproportional response of NaI(Tl) to electrons, an energy dependent function which was deduced from previous experimental work with gamma rays. Results of the calculations, applied to a 2.5-in. diameter by 2-in. high crystal, indicate a distinct broadening in the total absorption line in the case of Compton and pair-production events. The calculated fractional line width from this effect alone is negligible for energies below about 0.1 MeV and amounts to 2.6% at 0.15 MeV, 5.0% at 0.4 MeV, and 1.5% at 2.5 MeV. The dependence of this effect on the crystal size and source geometry is discussed.}
