# Experimental assessment of the capabilities and limitations of NaI(Tl) scintillation-based gamma ray spectrometry

## Abstract
We present measurements of the gamma ray spectra of six radioisotopes using a thallium-doped sodium iodide scintillation detector. We first explain the appearances of the spectra and calibrate the detector to allow energy measurements. We then analyse the spectra to derive three key measures of detector performance: resolution, intrinsic width and full energy peak efficiency. We relate the values of these parameters and their dependence on gamma ray energy to the capabilities and fundamental limitations of scintillation detection.
